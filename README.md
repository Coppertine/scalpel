# Scalpel
Scalpel: a Python toolset for Rhythm Doctor

just download the entire thing and run the .bat file.

This uses Pillow, so make sure you have that installed.

# Brief description of tools in the program

* Effect Repeater: Repeats any two effects for any amount of time. Pretty self explanatory, but can be used for complicated effects.

* Grade Calculator: The most simple tool. Run your song without Otto and with offsets on, and input the number of misses. It gives you the right numbers for the grades.

* Gif Exporter: Splits an animated Gif into its frames, and generates level code to display those frames in the right order with the right timing. MP4 support coming soonâ„¢

* Clone Hero BPM Converter: Tool made by Not El Donte and Klyzx. Converts a Clone Hero file into Rhythm Doctor BPM events.

* Stepmania/ITG BPM Converter: Converts a Stepmania/ITG chart into Rhythm Doctor BPM events.

* Easy Custom Characters: Generates foreground events to mimic a character's beat animation.
